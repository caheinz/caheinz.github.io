            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Serendipity</p>
            
            <p>Serendipity is a lifestyle brand. We partner with local artists and brands ontop of our in-house brand to curate a collection of unique pieces, from jewlery to stationary to home decor. Ten percent of our profits go to charities and organizations that empower women. </p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p> We cater to a mainly female audience, and anyone who appreciates quality artisan work. Our customers like to window shop, are thoughtful with their purchases, and like to support local. Our physical store is a very welcoming environment designed to be an experience, so our website aims to create the same appeal to the senses. In addition, our customers value sustainability and human rights. </p>
           
            <p>Serendipity's goal is to provide a selling space for underrecognized talent. By accumulating goods and products from independent craftsmen and smaller brands, our customers get to enjoy a diverse assortment of products in one shopping experience. While we want to make a profit, we also want to support female empowerment through donations.  </p>
